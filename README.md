# Team Protocol4 - COVID-19 Detection through Radiography images of Lung CT

This is a project that is part of the S21 UWaterloo CSC x DSC Project Program! 

## Overview

COVID-19 detection using Radiography images based on ResNet50V2 architecture. Our model is trained on 4 categories namely: COVID, Pneumonia, Lung Opacity and normal images to reduce false positives.

Currently, there is an urgent need for efficient tools to assess the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. In this project, we propose a constructive solution for detecting and labeling infected tissues on CT lung images of such patients. To cut down false positives our model is trained on 4 types of lung CT images : COVID, Viral Pneumonia, Lung Opacity and normal images to get the best possible results with highest accuracy.

We will be using Convolutional Neural networks and Deep Learning to solve this problem.

## About the Project

We have seen numerous friends and families fall prey to the vicious coronavirus. With the ever mutating virus, there is a need for faster detection of virus, so that swift assistance and medication can be given to the patients.

Currently, there is an urgent need for efficient tools to assess the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. In this project, we propose a constructive solution for detecting and labeling infected tissues on CT lung images of such patients. To cut down false positives our model is trained on 4 types of lung CT images : COVID, Viral Pneumonia, Lung Opacity and normal images to get the best possible results with highest accuracy.

We built it using Tensorflow 2.x using Python. We have developed a Convolutional Neural Network model with an average accuracy of more than 88%. 
We built an accompanying WebApp to interaface with our Convolutional model for easy access by anyone.

We experimented with numerous numbers of model and came up with top 5 models to represent our dataset. The challenge that we faced was finding the best dataset for training our model on. The other challenge we ran into was, our model's low accuracy and high loss. We worked on our model continously and fine tuned it to reach a very good accuracy.

We learned that COVID-19 can be succesfully detected through LUNG-CT images instead of tedious tests like Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) which takes almost 5 hours and Rapid detection tests which has a low accuracy.

Our model contains the best of both worlds with quick detection and high accuracy.
